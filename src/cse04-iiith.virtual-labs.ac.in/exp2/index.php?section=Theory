		   <h2>Problem 1</h2> <p> P is divisor of Q, if dividing Q by P does not leave any remainder. A number, N, is called a perfect number, if the sum of all such divisors of N(not including N) is equal to N. 6 is the smallest perfect number. It's factors are 1,2,3 and their sum is 1+2+3=6. So, to check whether a number, say N, is perfect or not, it is required to find all the divisors of that number. The easiest way to do this is to check every number form 2 to N-1 if it is dividing N completely or not, and take the sum of all the divisor. While this may work well for small numbers, it would be very time consuming for large numbers. </p> <p> A better solutin can be built by observing that many numbers can easily be ruled out as not divisors. For instance, all the numbers between N/2 and N cannot be divisors. Similarly, all numbers between N/2 and N/3 cannot be divisors of N, and so on. So, at each step we can check two numbers to be divisors of N and at the same time we can eliminate a fraction of the numbers less than N as not divisors and putting an upper bound on the next biggest possible divisor. Lets apply this tactic to find the divisors of 60. </p> <p> 60 divided by 2 gives 30 as the quotient and 0 as the remainder. So, 2 and 30 are divisors and there are no other divisors greater than 30. SUM=32+1=33 <br> 60 divided by 3 gives 20 as the quotient and 0 as the remainder. So, 3 and 20 are divisors and there are no other divisors greater than 20. SUM=33+23=46<br> 60 divided by 4 gives 15 as the quotient and 0 as the remainder. So, 4 and 15 are divisors and there are no other divisors greater than 15. SUM=46+19=65<br> 60 divided by 5 gives 12 as the quotient and 0 as the remainder. So, 5 and 12 are divisors and there are no other divisors greater than 12. SUM=65+17=82<br> 60 divided by 6 gives 10 as the quotient and 0 as the remainder. So, 6 and 10 are divisors and there are no other divisors greater than 10. SUM=82+16=98<br> 60 divided by 7 gives 8 as the quotient and 4 as the remainder. So, 7 is not a divisor and there are no other divisors greater than or equal to 8.<br> </p> <p> Now, we see that there is no need to see any more divisors. The divisors of 60 are 2,30,3,20,4,15,5,12,6 and 10. And their sum is 97. So, 60 is not a perfect number. Lets try this procedure on 28 which is the next prefect number after 6. </p> <p> 28 divided by 2 gives 14 as the quotient and 0 as the remainder. So, 2 and 14 are divisors and there are no other divisors greater than 14. SUM=1+16=17<br> 28 divided by 3 gives 9 as the quotient and 2 as the remainder. So, 3 is not a divisor and there are no other divisors greater than or equal to 9. SUM=17<br> 28 divided by 4 gives 7 as the quotient and 0 as the remainder. So, 4 and 7 are divisors and there are no other divisors greater than 7. SUM=17+11=28<br> 28 divided by 5 gives 5 as the quotient and 3 as the remainder. So, 5 is not a divisor and there are no other divisors greater than 5. SUM=28<br> </p> <p> We need not check any more numbers. The SUM is 28, and hence, 28 is a perfect number. </p> <br>  <h2>Problem 2</h2> <p> Consider the fraction A/B. We use two variables A,B to represent a fraction. Lets see how can we solve the problem. A/B = q + 1/E. How can we find q,E given A,B such that E&gt1. From math basics any fraction can be expressed A/B = step(A/B) + frac(A/B). frac(A/B)&lt 1 so 1/frac(A/B) &gt 1. Thus we shall choose q as step(A/B) and E as 1/frac(A/B). Now we shall see programatically how can we represent and E as we need to do the same operation on E. Obviosuly  from the above equation E = B/(A-B*q)  which means E is also a fraction. Thus we express E in terms of some (x,y) where x = B and y = A-B*q and do the same operation as we have done on (A,B). It is recommended to use while loop and handle the termination case properly while coding. </p>
