					In digital display systems, everything that is displayed, is displayed in terms of a smallest unit of display, which is called a pixel.
					This is in contrast to what we perceive the world to be as continuous.
					The space occupied by any image in digital display system is measured in terms of pixels.
					Thus we require to transform the continuous space in which we define he geometry of any figure to a discrete space for display in digital displays. This transformation is called <b>rasterization</b> or <b>scan conversion</b><br /><br />
					When a line is transformed from its continous form of <i>y = mx + c</i> into a discrete form of a set of pixels, this transformation is called <b>line rasterization</b>.
					Thus when we apply line rasterization technique on a line, &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>y = mx + c</i>, we obtain the set of pixels that are required to be filled in order to fit the given continuous line in the best possible manner.
					Some common algorithms to perform line rasterization are as follows:
					<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin">
						<li>Bresenham's line algorithm</li>
						<li>Digital Differential Analyzer(DDA) algorithm</li>
						<li>Xiaolin Wu's algorithm</li>
					</ol>
					Here we have discussed only the Bresenham's Line Rasterization algorithm.

					<h2>Bresenham's Line Rasterization Algorithm</h2>
					Bresenham's algorithm is a very popular algorithm due to its simplicity and speed.
					It helps to avoid floating point calculations, which was particulary useful in the days when floating point operations could not be handled by the computers.<br />
					<h4>Pseudo Code of the algorithm</h4>
					Input : Two Endpoints of the line, (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) &amp; (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>)<br />
					Assumption : For the description of the algorithm below, we have assumed the slope of the line(m) to have the constraint, 0 &lt; m &lt; 1. However the experiment works with any given line.<br />

					<legend><u>Steps of the Algorithm</u></legend>

    swap the endpoints
<li>&Delta;y = y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>0</sub>
&Delta;x = x<sub>1</sub> - x<sub>0</sub>
p<sub>0</sub> = 2*&Delta;y - &Delta;x</li>

					Objective of this experiment is to understand the steps of a Line Rasterization Algorithm, i.e., how a geometric line is converted to pixels in a 2D frame buffer. As an example, we have demonstrated the steps of Bresenham's Line Rasterization algorithm here.
