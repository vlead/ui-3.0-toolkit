						When a 2D image is displayed onto a display screen, often the display area occupies a fraction of the amount of space that covers the entire image area.
						Thus the unnecessary parts of the image that are located outside the display area can be removed to reduce the exorbitant amount of computations involved to render them.
						This technique to remove such inessential parts of a scene lying outside the display area is called <b>clipping</b>.
						The display area is also called the <b>clipped window</b>.<br /><br />
						The technique used to cut/clip the parts of the line belonging in the region, outside of the clipped window, is called <b>line clipping</b>.<br /><br />
						Some common algorithms to perform line clipping are as follows:
						<ol style="list-style-type:lower-latin">
							<li>Cohen-Sutherland algorithm</li>
							<li>Liang-Barsky algorithm</li>
							<li>Nicholl-Lee-Nicholl algorithm</li>
						</ol><br />
						Here we have discussed only the Cohen-Sutherland Line Clipping algorithm.

					<h2>Cohen Sutherland's Line Clipping Algorithm</h2>
					<h4>Pseudo Code of the algorithm</h4>
					Input : Two Endpoints of the line, (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) &amp; (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>).<br />Two opposite corner points of the frame buffer.<br />
					<fieldset>
					<legend><u>Steps of the Algorithm</u></legend>
					<pre>
<ol>
<li>P<sub>0</sub> = (x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>0</sub>) &amp; P<sub>1</sub>(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>).</li>
<li>Compute the 4-bit codes for each endpoint.
The codes of the vertices are computed from the below figure :

<center> Source : From Academic Tutorials</center>
0000 represents the clip window and all other areas outside are to be clipped.<br />
If both codes are 0000,(bitwise OR of the codes yields 0000 ) line lies completely inside the window: pass the endpoints to the draw routine.
If both codes have a 1 in the same bit position (bitwise AND of the codes is not 0000), the line lies outside the window. It can be trivially rejected.</li>
<li>If a line cannot be trivially accepted or rejected, at least one of the two endpoints must lie outside the window and the line segment crosses a window edge. This line must be clipped at the window edge before being passed to the drawing routine.</li>
<li>Examine one of the endpoints, say P<sub>0</sub> and read  P<sub>0</sub>'s 4-bit code in order: Left-to-Right, Bottom-to-Top.</li>
<li>When a set bit (1) is found, compute the intersection I of the corresponding window edge with the line from P<sub>0</sub> to P<sub>1</sub>. Replace P<sub>0</sub> with I and repeat the algorithm.</li>

					Objective of this experiment is to understand the steps of a Line Clipping Algorithm, i.e., how a geometric line is clipped so as to render only the part which a user can view.
					As an example, we have demonstrated the steps of Cohen Sutherland Algorithm.
