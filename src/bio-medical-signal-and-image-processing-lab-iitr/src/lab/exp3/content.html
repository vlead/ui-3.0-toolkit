	<p><strong>Digital image processing </strong>is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing. It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied  to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up  of noise and signal distortion during processing. Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps more) digital image processing may be modeled  in the form of multidimensional systems.<br>
Visual information plays an important role in almost  all areas of our life. Today, much of this information is represented and processed digitally. Digital  image processing is ubiquitous, with applications ranging from television to tomography, from photography to printing, from robotics to remote sensing.    
    <h3>Basic concepts </h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Morphological</strong><strong> </strong><strong>image</strong><strong> </strong><strong>processing</strong><strong> </strong>is a collection of non-linear operations related to the shape or morphology of features in an image.  Morphological operations rely only on the relative  ordering of pixel  values, not on their numerical values,  and therefore are especially suited  to the processing of binary images. Morphological operations can also be applied  to greyscale images such that their light transfer functions are unknown and therefore their absolute pixel values are of no or minor interest.</li>
</ul>
    <p>Morphological techniques probe an image with a small shape or template  called a structuring element. The structuring element  is positioned at all possible locations in the image  and it is compared with the corresponding neighborhood of pixels.  Some operations test whether  the element &quot;fits&quot; within  the neighborhood, while others test whether it &quot;hits&quot; or intersects the neighborhood:</p>
    <p><img src="images/Image_001.gif" style="width:492px;height:200px" alt=""/></p>
    <p>A morphological operation on a binary image creates a new binary image in which the pixel has a non-zero value only if the test is successful at that location in the input image.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pixel</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Transformation</strong><strong> </strong>is also known as Image Enhancement. The principal objective of enhancement is to process  an image so that the result is more suitable than the original  image for a specific application. So, the specific application may determine  approaches or techniques for image enhancement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Image Negative transformation </h2>
    <p>Gray level values  of the pixels in an image are inverted to get its negative image. Consider a 8 bit digital image of size M x N, then each pixel  value from original  image is subtracted from 255 as</p>
    <p>g (x,y) = 255- f (x,y)</p>
    <p>In a normalized gray scale, s = 1.0 – r<br>
      Negative images  are useful for enhancing white or gray detail  embedded in dark regions  of an image. Fig.1 shows clear tissue  in negative image of cyst.</p>
<p><img src="images/Image_002.jpg" style="width:554px;height:183px" alt=""/></p>
<p> <strong>Power-Law transformations </strong>have the basic form</p>
<p><img src="images/Image_019.JPG" style="width:344px;height:56px" alt=""/></p>
<p>Unlike the log function, a family of possible transformation curves obtained simply  by varying γ </p>
<p><img src="images/Image_003.jpg" style="width:609px;height:358px"  alt=""/></p>
<p><img src="images/Image_004.jpg" style="width:468px;height:282px" alt=""/></p>
<h2>Log Transformations </h2>
<p>s = c log(1+r)                   c : constant,  r &gt;= 0</p>
<p>We use a transformation of this type to expand the values of dark pixels  while compressing the higher-level values<br>
  The opposite  is true of the inverse  log transformation</p>
<p>It compresses the dynamic range  of images with large variations in pixel values</p>
<p><img src="images/Image_005.png" style="width:453px;height:270px" alt=""/></p>
<h2>Histogram Equilization </h2>
<p>Histogram equalization re-assigns the intensity values  of pixels in the input image such that the output  image contains a uniform  distribution of intensities</p>
<p>It is called histogram  linearization, too</p>
<p>The probability of occurrence of gray level k</p>
<h4>p(r=k) = nk/n   , k=0, 1, …, L-1</h4>
<p>where nk is the number of pixels in the image having gray level k We use the following transformation</p>
<p><img src="images/Image_020.JPG" style="width:447px;height:67px" alt=""/></p>
<p>This technique enhances appearance of a digital image by spreading gray levels so that they are evenly distributed across their range as shown in given fig.</p>
<p><img src="images/Image_006.jpg" style="width:586px;height:199px" alt=""/></p>
<h2>Filters </h2>
<h2>Gaussian Low Pass Filter </h2>
<p>A Gaussian  blur (also known  as Gaussian smoothing) is the result  of blurring an image by a Gaussian function</p>
<p>The Gaussian  blur is a type of image-blurring filters  that uses a Gaussian function (which  also expresses the normal  distribution in statistics)<br>
  for calculating the transformation to apply to each pixel in the image.  The equation of a Gaussian  function in one dimension is</p>
<p><img src="images/Image_007.jpg" style="width:176px;height:51px" alt=""/></p>
<p>in two dimensions, it is the product of two such Gaussians, one in each dimension:</p>
<p><em><img src="images/Image_008.png" style="width:377px;height:228px" alt=""/></em>
<h2>Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) </h2>
<p>The LOG module performs  a Laplacian of Gaussian filter.  This filter first applies a Gaussian  blur, then applies  the Laplacian filter  (see convolution) and finally checks for zero crossings  (i.e. when the resulting value goes from negative to positive  or vice versa).  The end result of this filter is to highlight edges.<br>
  Laplacian filters  are derivative filters  used to find areas of rapid change  (edges) in images. Since derivative filters  are very sensitive to noise, it is common to smooth the image (e.g., using a Gaussian  filter) before applying  the Laplacian.  This two-step process  is call the Laplacian  of Gaussian (LoG) operation.</p>
<p><img src="images/Image_009.jpg" style="width:368px;height:65px" alt=""/></p>
<p>There are different ways to find an approximate discrete convolution kernal that approximates the effect of the Laplacian. A possible  kernel is
<p><img src="images/Image_010.jpg" style="width:116px;height:100px" alt=""/>
<p>This is called a negative Laplacian  because the central peak is negative.  It is just as appropriate to reverse the signs of the elements,
using -1s and a +4, to get a positive  Laplacian. It doesn't  matter.
To include a smoothing Gaussian  filter, combine the Laplacian and Gaussian
<p><em><img src="images/Image_011.jpg" style="width:345px;height:77px" alt=""/></em>
<h2>Gabor Filters </h2>
<p>In image processing, a Gabor filter, named after Dennis Gabor, is a linear filter used for edge detection. Frequency and orientation representations of Gabor filters  are similar to those of the human visual system,  and they have been found to be particularly appropriate for texture  representation and discrimination. In the spatial  domain, a 2D Gabor filter  is a Gaussian kernel function modulated  by a sinusoidal plane wave. The Gabor filters  are self- similar: all filters can be generated from one mother  wavelet by dilation and rotation.</p>
<p><img src="images/Image_012.jpg" style="width:596px;height:393px" alt=""/><br clear="all">
</p>
<h2>Sobel Edge Detection </h2>
<p>The Sobel operator is used in image processing, particularly within edge detection algorithms. Technically, it is a discrete differentiation operator, computing an approximation of the gradient of the image intensity function. At each point in the image, the result of the Sobel operator is either the corresponding gradient vector  or the norm of this vector.  The Sobel operator  is based on convolving the image with a small, separable, and integer valued filter in horizontal and vertical direction and is therefore relatively inexpensive in terms of computations. On the other hand, the gradient approximation that it produces is relatively crude, in particular for high frequency  variations in the image.</p>
<p>The operator  uses two 3×3 kernels which are convolved with the original  image to calculate approximations of the derivatives - one for horizontal changes,  and one for vertical. If we define  A as the source  image, and Gx and Gy are two images which at each point contain the horizontal and vertical derivative approximations, the computations are as follows:</p>
<p><img src="images/Image_013.png" style="width:501px;height:73px" alt=""/>
<p>where * here denotes  the 2-dimensional convolution operation.
Since the Sobel kernels  can be decomposed as the products of an averaging  and a differentiation kernel, they compute the gradient with smoothing. For example Gx can be written as
<p><img src="images/Image_015.png" style="width:280px;height:74px" alt=""/>
<p>The x-coordinate is defined here as increasing in the &quot;right&quot;-direction, and 
the y-coordinate is defined as increasing in the &quot;down&quot;-direction. At each point in the image, the resulting gradient approximations can be combined to give the gradient magnitude, using:
<p><img src="images/Image_016.png" style="width:155px;height:37px" alt=""/><br clear="all">
Using this information, we can also calculate the gradient's direction:
<p><img src="images/Image_017.png" style="width:168px;height:22px" alt=""/>
<p>where, for example,  Θ is 0 for a vertical edge which is darker on the right  side.
<p><img src="images/Image_018.jpg" style="width:555px;height:184px" alt=""/>
<p>Similarly you can use custom  coefficients to apply convolution on an input image by passing  3×3 kernels in the given  input array. And in custom filter by entering formula for kernel as function of 'x' and 'y' in 'filter  parameter' box.
<h2>Segmentation Methods </h2>
<p>In computer vision, image segmentation is the process  of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments  (sets of pixels, also known as superpixels). The goal of segmentation is to simplify  and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.  Image segmentation is typically used to locate  objects and boundaries (lines, curves, etc.) in images.  More precisely, image segmentation is the process  of assigning a label  to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain visual characteristics.</p>
<p>The result  of image segmentation is a set of segments  that collectively cover the entire image, or a set of contours extracted  from the image (see edge detection). Each of the pixels in a region are similar  with respect to some</p>
<br clear="all">
<p>characteristic or computed property,  such as color, intensity, or texture. Adjacent regions  are significantly different  with respect to the same characteristic(s).</p>
