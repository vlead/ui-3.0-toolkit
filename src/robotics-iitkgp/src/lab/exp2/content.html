    The Slider-crank mechanism is used to transform rotational motion into translational motion by means of a rotating driving beam, a connection rod and a
    sliding body. In the present example, a flexible body is used for the connection rod. The sliding mass is not allowed to rotate and three revolute joints
    are used to connect the bodies. While each body has six degrees of freedom in space, the kinematical conditions lead to one degree of freedom for the whole
    system.</p>

 	A slider crank mechanism converts circular motion of the crank into linear motion of the slider. In order for the crank to rotate fully the condition L&gt; R+E must be
    satisfied where R is the crank length,L is the length of the link connecting crank and slider and E is the offset of slider. A slider crank is a RRRP type of mechanism i.e.
    It has three revolute joints and 1 prismatic joint. The total distance covered by the slider between its two extreme positions is called the path length. Kinematic inversion 
    of slider crank mechanisms produce ordinary a whitework quick return mechanism.
