* Introduction 
  The purpose of this documentation is to help the integration engineers in :
  - Converting the labs from VLABS UI-1.0 to VLABS UI-3.0
  - Structuring their labs to comply with a standard UI template

* Motivation 
  The motivation behind this document is to define the VLABS UI-3.0 Template
  and specify guidelines to be followed during the lab development process.
  This conversion is to ensure consistency of look and feel with reference to
  the main page. Responsive design and cross browser compatibility are not
  available as part of this conversion.

  This document can be used to 
  - Category 1- Develop a new lab to use VLABS UI-3.0 by following the lab
    structure described below.
  - Category 2- Convert a lab from VLABS UI-1.0 to VLABS UI-3.0. 
  - Category 3- Convert a lab to VLABS UI-3.0, if the sources are partially updated
    or the lab is partially converted to UI-3.0.
  
  Before converting a lab please ensure the category your lab falls into and
  follow the corresponding instructions. 


* VLABS UI-3.0 Definition 

** Category 1-Develop a new lab to use VLABS UI-3.0 by following the lab structure described below.
** Lab Structure
   
   Before you start using VLABS UI 3.0 Toolkit, you need to understand the
   structure of the lab.

** Details of the files of VLABS UI-3.0
   
   - "themes/green-icon" directory has css, images, js, vendors,
     search-result.html folders which are related to VLABS UI-3.0 version.

   - "src/lab" and "src/lab/exp1" directory has index.html, Introduction.html,
     Pre-requisites.html, Feedback.html etc., files which are related to the
     VLABS UI-3.0 version.

** Category 2- Convert a lab from VLABS UI-1.0 to VLABS UI-3.0
    
   Depending on the current structure of your lab, you need to follow
   the steps below to convert your lab to VLABS UI 3.0 template.
  
   - Take the reference of [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/physical-sciences-iiith][physical-sciences-lab]] of IIITH, which has been
     already converted to VLABS UI-3.0.
 
   - Make your lab to the above mentioned structure.  Copy themes/green-icon
     folder into the src directory of your lab.  This folder has all
     files/folders related to VLABS UI-3.0 version.

   - Inside "src/lab" and "src/lab/exp1", add index.html, Introduction.html
     etc. Modify the content of the templates accordingly as per your labs
     content.

   - Validate: After making the changes, run your lab in the browser to verify
     whether it is converted to VLABS UI-3.0.

** Category 3- Convert a lab to VLABS UI-3.0, if the sources are partially updated or the lab is partially converted to UI-3.0
   
   - Initially the analysis process is done on VLABS  UI-3.0 web pages. Based on
     the analysis, we are done with the conversion process by making the
     required changes.
    
     For the detailed information about the conversion and the changes made on
     VLABS UI-3.0 have been mentioned in 
     [[Technical Observations of VLABS UI-3.0 web pages]].
                                                                      
   - Update the new responsive footer in all the html files (path- "src/lab" )
     as per VLABS UI-3.0 landing page from the following link:
     "https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/blob/master/src/index.html "

   - Go to "
     https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/blob/master/src/css/style.css "
     this path and copy the style.css file to the lab repo you are working on,
     to this particular path "css" and remove the old "css/style.css" file.
     This is because css has been changed.  Like headers, subheaders, logo font
     size and footer has been changed in the Vlabs UI-3.0 landing page. so, all
     the web pages should be made consistent as per the main page.

   - Go to
     "https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/tree/master/src/images/social"
     and copy "youtube.png" image to the "images/social" path to the lab repo
     you are working on.

   - Update the new responsive footer in all the html files (path- "src/lab" )
     as per VLABS UI-3.0 landing page from the following link:
     "https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/blob/master/src/index.html "

   - Go to "
     https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/blob/master/src/css/style.css "
     this path and copy the style.css file to the lab repo you are working on,
     to this particular path "css" and remove the old "css/style.css" file.
     This is because css has been changed.  Like headers, subheaders, logo font
     size and footer has been changed in the VLABS UI-3.0 landing page. so, all
     the web pages should be made consistent as per the main page.

   - Go to
     "https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/tree/master/src/images/social "
     and copy "youtube.png" image to the "images/social" path to the lab repo
     you are working on.
  
   - Create green-icon folder under src/themes directory.

   - Now move css, images, js, vendors folders to the following path
     "src/themes/green-icon".

   - Create index.html file and copy the Introduction.html file content to the
     index.html file.  Note : If the index.html file already exists with the
     UI-1.0 content, take a backup of that file as index.html.bak and then
     create new index.html file.

   - Edit the path inside all the html files in the following path "src/lab"
     and "src/lab/exp1".  Set the path inside the files. In the "src/lab" path
     remove ../../ inside all the files. Inside the experiments it should be
     ../ path should be given wherever it is required. This is because makefile
     is written in a such a way that it copies all the lab content and themes
     content to the build, when we run the make. So, change the path of the
     files as per your lab.
 
   - Comment out the "search box" in all html files.

   - Comment out the previous makefile and update with "[[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/physical-sciences-iiith/blob/master/src/makefile][new makefile]]" .
   
   - Finally, run a make and run the lab in the browser to see all the changes,
     which you have made. Now you should be able to see the lab converted to
     VLABS UI-3.0.

* Technical Observations of VLABS UI-3.0 web pages

** Cross Browser Platform

   - Tested the lab on various platforms( OS with different browsers).
  
   - Used an online cross browser compatibility testing tool([[https://www.browserstack.com/][browserstack]]) to
     check the responsive of the VLABS UI_3.0 web pages on different
     resolutions.  This tool also gives the [[https://www.browserstack.com/screenshots?utm_campaign=onboarding&utm_medium=email&utm_source=welcome][screenshots]] of the browsers just by
     one click to check the responsiveness of the website.

   - Link to see the responsiveness of websites in [[https://www.browserstack.com/responsive?utm_campaign=onboarding&utm_medium=email&utm_source=welcome][mobiles and tablets.]]  

** Issues regarding responsiveness of VLABS web pages with cross browser compatability testing using above mentioned tool

*** LOGO
   
    - Logo size should be same across all the pages. Currently it is getting
      changed on different pages.

*** Footer

    - Footer is not responsive in all the labs. Only the landing page has
      responsive footer. Need to change the footer as per VLABS UI-3.0 landing
      page in all the labs.

*** Feedback footer

    - Footer is not responsive for the feedback link in all the pages.

*** css issue 

    - Font size of the headers and sub headers in all the labs is different
      compared to VLABS landing page.
    - Font size of the tabs in the feedback is different compared to landing
      page.

*** Banner

   - Banner of the landing page is not responsive.(tag line should be made
     responsive). The text(Example: Analytics) on the banner is getting
     overlapped in the small screen.

*** Search box

    - Search box is not responsive after some resolution and also its not
      working the way it should work.  So, it should be fixed or either it
      should be commented out.

* Conclusion
 
 - Based on the mentioned points, VLABS UI-3.0 web pages are not fully
   responsive. However, the labs linked to the landing page with the VLABS
   UI-1.0 web pages are not responsive at all. So, it is suggested that the
   conversion to VLABS UI-3.0 is done, to ensure consistency of look and feel
   with reference to the main page.
 - After conversion, your lab should match the directory structure as detailed
   above and should resemble the following [[images/phy-sci.png][page]].
